This change felt necessary as most shots were taken at 80% power or higher on average.</li> <li>Removed an obscure feature where ball spin decays slower in the air than on the ground. This feature was too buggy to maintain.</li> <li>Set physics stepping to \"fixed\" to help physics consistency.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-1-gameplay-rebalance/#course-changes","title":"Course Changes","text":"<ul> <li>Verdant Hills: Has seen many platforms expanded to suit the easy difficulty better. Additionally, Hole 3 had the \"hill\" part lowered to make the normal path easier.</li> <li>Desertified Oasis: Has had many water hazards reduced in size, others removed, as well as collision adjustments to prevent getting stuck in weird places that require a stroke to move to a better spot instead of progressing. Widened the gap for the ghost flag entrance.</li> <li>Lofstrom Links: Has seen some tighter segments (such as Hole 9's internal section) adjusted to be less precise.</li> <li>Eye of the Storm: Ghost Flag entrance position was moved to prevent the main hole from being invalidated. (Your Personal Bests will be reset on this hole).</li> <li>Teleporter Lab: Was given many \"indents\" to reduce \"roll-offs\" where the ball rolls off into water hazards if you hit it slightly too hard. Most \"No Teleporter\" routes have been modified to be less painful. Some holes will be revamped in the future.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-1-gameplay-rebalance/#gameplay-fixes","title":"Gameplay Fixes","text":"<ul> <li>The green on Hole 2 of Desertified Oasis was expanded to fix \"part split\" collision bugs from happening too frequently while attempting the Rebounder achievement.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-1-gameplay-rebalance/#bug-fixes","title":"Bug Fixes","text":"<ul> <li>Fixed an obscure bug where the \"Unreal Air\" achievement would sometimes get stuck in an endless loop, causing the console to throw errors every frame.</li> <li>Fixed a rare bug where character collisions are sometimes not disabled if the character is created rather late.</li> <li>Fixed the Multiplayer Server List not allowing console navigation when the server list is refreshed.</li> <li>Fixed a bug that sometimes bricked multiplayer servers randomly between holes.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-1-gameplay-rebalance/#upcoming","title":"Upcoming","text":"<ul> <li>Watered-Down Slews and Arctic Mountains will be receiving major revamps alongside the upcoming Tour 3 Update.</li> <li>Gloomy Cliffside may be included, but don't keep your hopes up for that one.</li> <li>Badges will be added with the Tour 3 Update, all achievements currently obtained will be awarded when you join the game post-update.</li> </ul> <p>Please report any bugs in \u2060bug-reports so we can deal with them quickly. </p>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-multiplayer/","title":"Let's Go Golfing! v0.3 - Multiplayer Update","text":"<p>Release Date: March 20, 2025</p> <p>At long last, you can now play alongside any of your friends!</p>"},{"location":"updates/v0-3-multiplayer/#major-changes","title":"Major Changes","text":"<ul> <li>Multiplayer Support!
