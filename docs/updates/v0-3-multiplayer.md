*This update is very prone to bugs and inconsistencies, please report anything you find in ‚Å†bug-reports.*

**Next Update Teaser:** Tour 3 (finally), Gameplay Updates, Achievement Icons, Badges.

*All courses impacted by future gameplay changes will have your personal bests reset if they're below -25 in Standard, or a -150 in Time Attack. These are the lowest scores I intend to be possible on every course, so they'll be reset to that value if below it.*
